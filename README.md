sudo nano compose.yml
```

Then copy the **compose.yml** into the repository then you can adjust the **MAX_FILE_SIZE** if you need to.

Then when the changes are done do **CONTROL + C**, and **CONTROL + X** and then type **y** and then hit **ENTER**,

- **Step 5:** Compose up

Then do the following command 

**To run as a background service.**
```bash
sudo docker compose up -d

**For testing.**
```bash
sudo docker compose up
