# LanParty Fileserver - Code of Conduct
1. Our Pledge
   We, as contributors, maintainers, and leaders of the Holonet project, are dedicated to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to a positive environment, ensuring that all voices can be heard and valued, allowing the Holonet project to benefit from a wide range of perspectives and thrive through respectful collaboration.

## 2. Our Standards
   We strive to create a positive and professional atmosphere. Examples of behavior that contribute to this include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language: Being mindful of the impact of words and choosing inclusive terminology (e.g., using gender-neutral language where appropriate, respecting chosen pronouns).

Being respectful: Valuing differing viewpoints, experiences, and feedback, even when disagreeing. Engaging in constructive, not destructive, dialogue.

Gracefully accepting constructive criticism: Viewing feedback as an opportunity for growth and improvement for both individuals and the project.

Focusing on what is best for the community: Prioritizing collective goals and the health of the community over personal preferences or agendas.

Showing empathy towards other community members: Seeking to understand others' perspectives and acknowledging their feelings and experiences.

Collaborating effectively and courteously: Working together constructively, sharing knowledge, offering assistance, and acknowledging the contributions of others.

Maintaining professionalism: Keeping interactions respectful and focused on the project, especially in official channels.

Assuming good intent: Approaching interactions with the assumption that participants mean well, while still addressing problematic behavior.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior
   We explicitly prohibit harassment and other unacceptable behaviors. Examples include:

Harassment: Offensive comments related to personal characteristics protected in our pledge, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Abuse: Violent threats or language directed against another person, discriminatory jokes and language, posting sexually explicit or violent material.

Disrespectful Conduct: Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, public or private personal attacks, spreading misinformation or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) maliciously.

Privacy Violations: Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission (doxing).

Dishonesty: Knowingly making false claims, misrepresenting affiliation, or impersonating others.

Unprofessional Conduct: Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting, including sustained disruption, unwelcome physical contact (at events), or advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

Subtle "-isms": Microaggressions and other subtle forms of bias or prejudice, even if unintentional.

## 4. Scope
   This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Holonet project. This includes, but is not limited to:

Project repositories (e.g., code hosting platforms, issue trackers).

Official communication channels (e.g., chat servers, forums, mailing lists).

Project-related events (online or offline meetups, conferences, workshops).

Direct communications related to the project.

It applies to all participants â€“ contributors, maintainers, sponsors, event attendees, and anyone else engaging with the Holonet community. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces (e.g., using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event).

## 5. Enforcement Responsibilities & Process
   Project maintainers and designated Code of Conduct committee members (if applicable) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards.

Reporting: Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the designated point of contact at r2unit@proton.me. Reports can be made anonymously if desired, though this may limit the ability to investigate fully or follow up. Please include as much detail as possible (description of the incident, time, location/URL, individuals involved, witnesses if any, and any supporting evidence).

Confidentiality: The privacy and confidentiality of the reporter and, where appropriate, the accused, will be respected throughout the process. Details will only be shared with those who strictly need to know for investigation and enforcement purposes.

Review: All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Receipt of a report will typically be acknowledged within 48 business hours.

Response: The enforcement team will determine the appropriate response based on the investigation findings. This response will be communicated to the reporter (where possible) and the person accused.

Fairness: All parties involved will have an opportunity to share their perspective, where appropriate and safe to do so.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions (comments, commits, code, issues, etc.) that violate this Code of Conduct, and to take corrective action against any participant whose behavior is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 6. Consequences for Violations
   Upon determining that a violation has occurred, the project maintainers or CoC committee will take action appropriate to the severity and context of the violation. Possible consequences include, but are not limited to:

Correction: Requesting modification or removal of violating content.

Warning: A formal warning regarding the behavior.

Temporary Ban: A temporary suspension from some or all project spaces.

Permanent Ban: A permanent expulsion from some or all project spaces.

Decisions will be documented internally. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may themselves face consequences, determined by other members of the project's leadership. There may be a process for appealing decisions, which would be detailed separately if established.

## 7. Attribution
   This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html, and incorporates ideas from other community codes of conduct.
